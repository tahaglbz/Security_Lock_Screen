# Lock Screen & Security System with Python and Tkinter

This project functions as a lock screen for a computer, requiring the user to enter a password. If the user does not enter the password, an alarm is triggered and the camera is activated. The video recording from the camera is saved to the system. Additionally, this system locks keyboard shortcuts to prevent the user from exiting. This serves as a security solution to prevent unauthorized access.
